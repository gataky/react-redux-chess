react-redux-chessboard *WIP*
---

To run the program run the following commands 

**note: this was bootstrapped with `creat-react-appi` so it's going to download a lot of stuff**

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) as long as there is nothing else running on that port. Otherwise is will try another port and tell you in the output.
